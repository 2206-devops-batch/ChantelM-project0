# About the Project

![Example game_bot game of Tic Tac Toe](/images/game_bot_autoplay.png)

## Purpose & Goal

Bots on Discord are known as a useful tool for automating tasks. To reduce the
robotic feel of automated introductions, game_bot breaks the ice by facilitating
a game of TicTacToe between 2 server members.

The created Discord bot (game_bot) communicates with a server over a local area network.
The server provides persistent game data storage by maintaining all instances of a game
along with associated players' data.
